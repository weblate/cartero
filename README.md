![Cartero: the free HTTP client to test your APIs](doc/images/cartero-banner.png)

Cartero is a graphical HTTP client that can be used as a developer tool to
test web APIs and perform all kind of HTTP requests to web servers. It is
compatible with any REST, SOAP or XML-RPC API and it supports multiple request
methods as well as attaching body payloads to compatible requests.

**Features:**

- Loads and saves to plain Git-friendly TOML files, so that you can own your data.
- Customization and modification of the request headers and body payloads.
- Variable binding for API keys and other secret information.

**Motivation:**

This project exists because there aren't many native graphical HTTP testing
applications / graphical alternatives to cURL that are fully free software, and
I think the world has had enough of Electron / non-native applications that are
anonymously accesible until one day you are forced to create an account and
log in to use just to make some investor happy with their numbers or to chug
some unwanted artificial intelligence at users.

### Get it from your package manager

Note: distributions in package managers are maintained by the community. While I am open to provide help and communication with maintainers of those ports, outdated versions and other packaging issues should be reported first to the package manager or to the package maintainer, not upstream.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/cartero.svg)](https://repology.org/project/cartero/versions)

You can also get it from Homebrew by using the tap:

```bash
brew tap SoloAntonio/cartero
brew install --cask cartero
```

Additional instructions [in the docs][homebrew].

If you use NixOS you can also add the flake.
Check the instructions [in the docs][flake] as well.

## Building

Currently, to build the application you'll have to make sure that the required
libraries are installed on your system.

- glib >= 2.72
- gtk >= 4.14
- gtksourceview >= 5.4
- libadwaita >= 1.5
- openssl >= 1.0

For a successful build, will also need the following packages installed in your system: **meson**, **ninja**, **rust** and **gettext**.

Then use the following commands to build and install the application

```sh
meson setup build
ninja -C build
ninja -C build install
```

To avoid installing system-wide the application, you can use a prefix:

```sh
meson setup build --prefix=/usr
ninja -C build
ninja -C build install
```

## Hacking and contributing

**If you plan on contributing to the project**, use the development profile.
It will also configure a Git hook so that the source code is checked prior to
authoring a Git commit. The hook runs `cargo fmt` to assert that the code is
formatted. Read `hooks/pre-commit.hook` to inspect what the script does.

```sh
meson setup build -Dprofile=development
```

If you want to hack the source code and make your own changes to Cartero, you
can do it as long as you know enough Rust and enough about GTK and the rest of the
libraries it uses. Check out the [hacking instructions][hacking].
It provides instructions useful for those who want to compile, test and run the
application, specifically how to compile the resource bundles and run the application.

If you want to share your changes with the world, you could send a pull request to
add the code to Cartero so that anyone can benefit from it. Information on how to
contribute has moved to [the website][contributing].

**Other ways to contribute to Cartero also include reporting bugs, sending feedback,
talking about Cartero to other people to make the project more popular, and sending
translations**. We are using [Weblate][weblate] to coordinate and translate comfortably
this project using a web interface. Make an account and start proposing strings and they
will be added to the application. That will also entitle you as a contributor!
